======================================
Cleaver ([kle-v…ôr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key)) a paste bin for
text, images and files. 

It's concept and basic functionality is borrowed from the software
[*Stikked*](https://github.com/claudehohl/Stikked/ "Stikked"). However, Cleaver 
adds a couple of nifty features like image/file paste, paste administration, authentification, 
categories and feeds.
